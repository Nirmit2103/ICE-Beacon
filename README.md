# 🚑 Emergency NFC Medical System

A powerful emergency healthcare platform that uses NFC-enabled devices (wristbands, cards, keychains, stickers) to allow instant access to vital medical information and emergency contacts. Designed to save lives by providing quick access to essential data without requiring a login.

---

## 📱 Platform Overview

This project includes:

- 🌐 **Website** (built with Next.js + TypeScript)
- 📦 **Firebase backend** (Auth + Firestore)
- 📲 **NFC integration** (read-only via tag scan)
- 🛒 **E-commerce section** to purchase NFC products
- 📖 **Medical history management**
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Doctor login access** to view full health records
- 📦 Planned: **Mobile App** with health reminders & tracking

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Registration:**
   - Enters name, age, blood group, known conditions, emergency contact, etc.
   - Data is stored securely in Firebase Firestore.

2. **NFC Tag Generation:**
   - A unique link is generated for each user.
   - That link is written onto an NFC tag (via NFC Tools App).

3. **Emergency Scan:**
   - Anyone can scan the NFC tag with their phone.
   - The browser opens and shows only **vital emergency info** (no login required).

4. **Full History Access:**
   - Doctors or users can log in with credentials to view full records & prescriptions.

5. **E-Commerce:**
   - Users can purchase NFC wristbands, cards, keychains, and stickers directly from the website.

## 🔒 Security

- Sensitive medical data is stored securely in Firestore with proper access rules.
- Public emergency data is minimal and anonymized.
- Only logged-in users or verified doctors can access full history.
